CO-LOCALIZATION CODE V1
========================================

DESCRIPTION
====================
Given a set of images, the co-localization problem simultaneously localizes (with bounding boxes) the common object class present across each image. This code is an implementation of the box model introduced in [1]. If you use this code in your research, please cite our paper [1]. Note that several parts of the model from [1] are excluded (image model, saliency prior) in order to decrease the dependencies required by this release.


USAGE
====================
1. In "globals.m", change the <base_dir> variable to point to the absolute path of this folder.

2. Run the "colocalize.m" file to co-localize the images in <image_dir> defined in "globals.m". We've included some sample images from PASCAL in the default <image_dir> for testing purposes.


EXTERNAL CODE
====================
In the ext/ directory, we include VLFeat [2] and Objectness [3], which are used in our code.
